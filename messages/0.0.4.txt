Project Specific Syntax 0.0.4
-----------------------------

Generating the key/value pairs to specify your custom syntax settings is now much easier!

Open an existing file in your project, set the syntax you would like to use for that file with the `View > Syntax > ...` menus (or the command palette), right click in the file editor area, and select the `Project Specific Syntax > Copy syntax setting to clipboard` menu item. This menu item is also available via the command palette. Once copied to the clipboard, simply open your project file and paste the new key/value pair into the `syntax_override` section. Be sure to add any necessary commas to separate multiple key/value pairs so your project file is still valid JSON.
